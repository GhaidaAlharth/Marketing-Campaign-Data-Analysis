This repository contains a data analysis project focused on analyzing marketing campaign data to understand the factors influencing the success of term deposit subscription. The primary goal of this analysis is to inform the development of future advertising campaigns and optimize the utilization of employee resources.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [bank.csv](data/bank.csv), which contains information about marketing campaigns conducted by a bank. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, campaign details, and the outcome of the marketing campaign (term deposit subscription).

## Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between the duration of contact between bank employees and customers and the likelihood of term deposit subscription.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of key variables, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between variables.

3. **Duration Analysis**: A key focus of the analysis is on understanding the impact of the duration of contact on term deposit subscription. We explore the distribution of contact durations and investigate how it correlates with the outcome of the marketing campaign.

4. **Campaign Optimization**: Based on the insights gained from the analysis, we provide recommendations for optimizing future marketing campaigns. This includes strategies for maximizing the effectiveness of employee time and improving the conversion rate of customers into term deposit subscribers.
